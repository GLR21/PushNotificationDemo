## Setup

On Android Studio, go to `Main Menu > Tools > Firebase > Cloud Messaging` and select one of the two options, `Set up Firebase Cloud message` or `Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging[Java]`. Follow the steps to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging. This will add the necessary dependencies to your project.

Also, a google account is needed to set up Firebase. If you don't have one, create a new account. You can use your existing Google account to sign in to Firebase.
